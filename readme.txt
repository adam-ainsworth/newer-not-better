Prevents selected plugins bugging you about updates

== Description ==

Sometimes newer isn't always better.

You won't always want to update a given plugin. Perhaps the design has been changed, or a bug has been introduced. Maybe it has been taken over by someone new and they've added loads of obnoxious ads or other sneaky monetisation methods. Or perhaps you just like it the way it is.

However, WP keeps telling you there's a new version available, and lists it along with other plugins which you may actually want to update.

What happens if you accidentally update? At best, it's a tedious downgrade process, at worst it may completely mess up the data that the plugin was using. In any case, it's a pain and there's no ignore update function in WP.

*Until now!*

== Installation ==

1. Unpack the entire contents of this plugin zip file into your wp-content/plugins/ folder locally
2. Upload to your site
3. Navigate to wp-admin/plugins.php on your site (your WP plugin page)
4. Activate this plugin. 

OR you can just install it with WordPress by going to Plugins >> Add New >> and type this pluginâ€™s name

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I select all plugins? =

You can, although it's not recommended. This is only for plugins that you have a specific reason not to update. Most are well maintained, play nice and updates are usually better.

To do so, just select all on the options page by clicking the checkbox at the top.

= Can I re-enable updates to a plugin? =

Of course, just deselect it in the plugin options page.

= Can I buy you a coffee for helping me avoid annoying updates / notifications =

You don't have to, but if you would like to buy me a coffee or a beer, please visit https://adamainsworth.co.uk/donate

the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).
